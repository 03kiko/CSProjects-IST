# CSProjects-IST
This repository comprises a compilation of projects completed during my Bachelor's in Computer Science at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). The projects are categorized by year and course. Please note that certain documentation might be missing due to constraints on public sharing.

## Courses
- Foundations of Programming (FP):
  - Language used: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [Project 1](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/blob/main/1st%20year/FP/P1.py):
    - Implemented a set of functions to solve three independent tasks::
      1) Text Justification;
      2) Calculate mandates using Hondt method;
      3) Solve systems of equations.
  - [Project 2](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/blob/main/1st%20year/FP/P2.py):
    - Developed a simple minesweeper game.
- Logic for Programming (LP):
  - Language used: [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)
  - [Project](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/blob/main/1st%20year/LP/projeto-lp.pl):
    - Tasks involved various problem-solving challenges.
  - [Data](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/blob/main/1st%20year/LP/dados.pl) (given by our teacher)
  - [Keywords](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/blob/main/1st%20year/LP/keywords.pl) (given by our teacher)
- Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures (IADS):
  - Language used: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
  - [Project 1](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/blob/main/1st%20year/IAED/project1.c)
  - [Project 2](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/tree/main/1st%20year/IAED/project2)
    - Built a public transport route management system for both projects.
    - The second project expanded into dynamic memory utilization, unlike the first project which operated within static memory constraints.
- Introduction to Computer Architecture (ICA):
  - Language used: [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
  - [Project 1](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/tree/main/1st%20year/IAC/P1)
  - [Project 2](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/tree/main/1st%20year/IAC/P2)
    - Developed a space voyage simulation game navigating the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. 
    - Collaboration with two colleagues on these projects.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
  - Language used: [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
  - [Project](https://github.com/03kiko/Uni-Projects/tree/main/2nd%20year/PO):
    - Created a simple spreadsheet
    - Collaboration with: [Filipe Costa](https://github.com/FilipeAlexCosta).
- Operating Systems (OS):
  - Language used: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
  - [Project 1](https://github.com/03kiko/CSProjects-IST/tree/main/2nd%20year/SO/P1)
  - [Project 2](https://github.com/03kiko/CSProjects-IST/tree/main/2nd%20year/SO/P2)
    - Developed an EMS (Event Management System) using multiple threads and processes.
    - The second project used a named pipe approach, in which each client represented a process and the server used S threads.
  - Collaboration with: [Filipe Costa](https://github.com/FilipeAlexCosta).
- Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms (ASA):
  - Language used: [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) & [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [Project 1](https://github.com/03kiko/CSProjects-IST/tree/main/2nd%20year/ASA/P1)
  - [Project 2](https://github.com/03kiko/CSProjects-IST/tree/main/2nd%20year/ASA/P2)
  - [Project 3](https://github.com/03kiko/CSProjects-IST/tree/main/2nd%20year/ASA/P3)
    - The primary objective was to devise efficient algorithms for these tasks, with the initial project emphasizing dynamic programming, the second one concentrating on identifying strongly connected components (SCCs), and the third one centring around the application of linear programming.
  - Collaboration with: [Filipe Costa](https://github.com/FilipeAlexCosta).
