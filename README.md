# Uni Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects that I completed during my time at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/). The projects are organized by year and course, and each project has its own folder containing the code, data, and any relevant documentation.

# Contributing
This repository is for archival purposes only, and I am not accepting contributions at this time. However, feel free to fork the repository and use the code for your own learning purposes.
