  - [Project 3](https://github.com/03kiko/CSProjects-IST/tree/main/2nd%20year/ASA/P3)
    - The primary objective was to devise efficient algorithms for these tasks, with the initial project emphasizing dynamic programming, the second concentrating on identifying strongly connected components (SCCs), and the third centring around applying linear programming.
  - Collaboration with: [Filipe Costa](https://github.com/FilipeAlexCosta).
- Artificial Intelligence (AI):
  - Language used: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [Project](https://github.com/03kiko/CSProjects-IST/tree/main/2nd%20year/AI)
